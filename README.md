# SereyRoattanaSim-UGDC
Hi, I'm Roattana. I am a student at JPA. I tend to be a quiet individual but when I am really interested or have an idea that I believe is worth the sharing, I would speak up about it. I like music and mystery books. 
I wanted to join the JPA Unity club because I have alway been interested in becoming a website designer or programmer. I wanted to join to help me hone my skills and learn more about coding and using it to create projects or, in this case, games.
